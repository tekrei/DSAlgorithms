/**
 * Binary search implementation
 *
 * Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array.
 * If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated
 * and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle
 * element to compare to the target value,
 * and repeating this until the target value is found.
 * If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in
 * the array.
 *
 * Complexity: average and worst case O(log n), best case O(1)
 *
 * @see <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm />

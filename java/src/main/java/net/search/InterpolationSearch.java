/**
 * Interpolation search implementation
 *
 * Resembles Binary search algorithm.
 * By comparison, binary search always chooses the middle of the remaining
 * search space,
 * discarding one half or the other,
 * depending on the comparison between the key found at the estimated position
 * and the key sought â€” it does not require numerical values for the keys, just
 * a total order on them.
 * The remaining search space is reduced to the part before or after the
 * estimated position.
 * The linear search uses equality only as it compares elements one-by-one from
 * the start, ignoring any sorting.
 *
 * Complexity: worst case O(n), best case O(1), average case O(log(log(n)))
 *
